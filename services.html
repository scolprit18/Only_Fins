                <h2>What is soft washing?</h2>
                <p>Soft washing is the process of using chemicals to do the work 
    of cleaning, instead of pressure. Your roof is extremely expensive, 
    and it requires care. If properly cared for, it can last a long time. 
    If not cared for, it can deteriorate, leak and just down right just 
    look unappealing. It can also cause excess heat to be stored in the attic, 
    which raises your electric bill. If you try to get the roof cleaned, but 
    it's done improperly, you can do more damage than good. Using high pressure 
    will destroy your shingles or tiles, and it can push water into your attic. 
    This is detrimental to your roof, as well as a roof's warranty. It can also 
    be immediately spotted by an insurance claim agent, and they will not pay 
    to have your roof replaced. It needs to be done right. All roof's in Florida 
    need to be cleaned every handful of years. The only way to do this the right 
    way, is through a soft wash.</p>

            <section id="seal-pavers">
                <h2>How do we seal pavers?</h2>
                <p>Pavers and Travertine need to be sealed every few years. The Florida sun 
        is harsh, and we're not the only ones who feel it. The heat bakes the 
        stones and slowly deteriorates the sealer. If your pavers are around a 
        pool, the chemicals in pool water, or added foot traffic speed up the 
        process as well. You can often see the difference between the locations 
        that have shade and light foot traffic versus the areas in the direct sun. 
        Once the sealer breaks down, it allows weeds to begin to grow through the 
        joints in each stone. A proper sealant will bring this to a halt, and make 
        everything look like new! Sealing the pavers requires the location to be 
        emptied of all furniture and nik naks, so we can properly clean the location 
        that will be sealed. Then, we will spend a few hours slowly getting paver 
        sand into each joint, which helps keep each stone in place, where it belongs. 
        Once the sand is filling each joint, we will apply the necessary amount of 
        sealant, which is a 2 part water based epoxy. This is some heavy duty stuff, 
        and gives a beautiful finished product.</p>

            <section id="rust">
                <h2>Can we get rid of rust stains?</h2>
                <p>Some fertilizers, and the reclaimed water we use to water our lawns through 
        our sprinkler system often contains iron, which soaks into a concrete 
        driveway, or pavers, and gives it a terrible appearance. There are ways to 
        get rid of nearly all of it, as long as it is done semi frequently. If you 
        let it soak in, and don't do anything about it for many years, it will be 
        nearly impossible to bring back to new.</p>
