                <h2>Who is Only Fins Power Washing?</h2>
                <p>Only Fins Powerwashing LLC is an exterior cleaning service 
                out of East Lake Woodlands, in Oldsmar, FL. We offer many services 
                including pressure washing of decks, patios, driveways, sidewalks, 
                home exterior, vinyl fencing, and more. We also offer Soft Washing 
                for the more delicate surfaces, such as your roof or pool patio screen.

                <h2>What</h2>
                <p><b>What sets us apart</b> from the others is we work hand in hand with a local, 
                very competent pool service company, Dog Days Pools. Pressure washing is 
                a cleaning process, but that process causes other areas to get dirty. 
                Your pool will often take the brunt of this. Because we work with Dog Days 
                Pools, this gives us the ability to vacuum your pool within 24 hours, add 
                some chemicals if need be, and get you jump started to having a crystal                     
                clear pool to match the clean pool patio and algae free lanai!</p>

                    <h3>What is soft washing?</h3>
                    <p>Soft washing is the process of using chemicals to do the work 
                    of cleaning, instead of pressure. Your roof is extremely expensive, 
                    and it requires care. If properly cared for, it can last a long time. 
                    If not cared for, it can deteriorate, leak and just down right just 
                    look unappealing. It can also cause excess heat to be stored in the attic, which raises your electric bill. If you try to get the roof cleaned, but it's done improperly, you can do more damage than good. Using high pressure will destroy your shingles or tiles, and it can push water into your attic. This is detrimental to your roof, as well as a roof's warranty. It can also be immediately spotted by an insurance claim agent, and they will not pay to have your roof replaced. It needs to be done right. All roof's in Florida need to be cleaned every handful of years. The only way to do this the right way, is through a soft wash.</p>

                    <h3>How do we seal pavers?</h3>
                    <p>Pavers and Travertine need to be sealed every few years. The Florida sun is harsh, and we're not the only ones who feel it. The heat bakes the stones and slowly deteriorates the sealer. If your pavers are around a pool, the chemicals in pool water, or added foot traffic speed up the process as well. You can often see the difference between the locations that have shade and light foot traffic versus the areas in the direct sun. Once the sealer breaks down, it allows weeds to begin to grow through the joints in each stone. A proper sealant will bring this to a halt, and make everything look like new! Sealing the pavers requires the location to be emptied of all furniture and nik naks, so we can properly clean the location that will be sealed. Then, we will spend a few hours slowly getting paver sand into each joint, which helps keep each stone in place, where it belongs. Once the sand is filling each joint, we will apply the necessary amount of sealant, which is a 2 part water based epoxy. This is some heavy duty stuff, and gives a beautiful finished product.</p>

                <section id="rust">
                    <h3>Can we get rid of rust stains?</h3>
                    <p>Some fertilizers, and the reclaimed water we use to water our lawns through our sprinkler system often contains iron, which soaks into a concrete driveway, or pavers, and gives it a terrible appearance. There are ways to get rid of nearly all of it, as long as it is done semi frequently. If you let it soak in, and don't do anything about it for many years, it will be nearly impossible to bring back to new.</p>
